Peace be upon you
How are you, heroes? I hope you’re all doing well ♥
The new assignment we have is to create a website exactly like this one:
https://grid-masterclass.webflow.io/

🔴 The requirement is super easy 🤩:

We will build the outer layout using CSS Grid, and inside each box we will use Flexbox as usual.
The task is simple, and it’s a chance to practice everything we’ve learned ❤

Deadline: Sunday at 10 PM
